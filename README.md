# Creation of the Personal Portfolio (Digital Resume)
## Project Description
As part of the HTML and CSS learning experience, the objective of the Challenge 2 was to create a portfolio of work to show case the core skills learned so far in the bootcamp: flexbox, media queries and the CSS variables. 

The project focused on the following points:
-	Being able to create a webpage without any starter code.
-	Utilize the concepts mentioned above to create a mobile responsive application that can be viewed using a desktop, a tablet and/or a smart phone.
-	When the portfolio is loaded, the user is able to view the developer’s name and current photo/avatar.
-	All navigation links must be functional and take the user directly to the desired sections (About Me, Projects or Contact information).
-	As the user navigates through the links and projects, the use can clearly identify which link/project he/she is looking at. 
-	Additionally, when a user clicks on the project’s image, the user is taken to the deployed application. 

The project allows to gather a further insight in the creation of the page and to better understand the potential challenges with the process (understanding the concept of the flexbox and its properties to be able to style the application in CSS). It provides an insight into the complexity of the webpage development process and the strategies to use to achieve the desired outcome (create a map of all elements and their location first, and then create them in the HTML and CSS).
